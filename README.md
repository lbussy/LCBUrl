This library was written by and for a non-professional programmer.  If you find some use out of it, that will make me happy, but if not, I'm still using it in my projects.

This library will parse a URL, and normalize it according to the information provided in [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).  Take for example this terrifying URL:

`http://%7EFoo:%7Ep@$$word@servername.local:80/%7Ethis/is/a/./path/test.php?foo=bar#frag`

LCBUrl will allow you to parse and access the hostname, user name, password, path, query string, fragment, etc.:

- `getUrl()` returns: `http://~Foo:~p@$$word@servername.local/~this/is/a/./path/test.php?foo=bar#frag`
- `getIPUrl()` returns: `http://~Foo:~p@$$word@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/~this/is/a/./path/test.php?foo=bar#frag`
- `getScheme()` returns: `http`
- `getUserInfo()` returns: `~Foo:~p@$$word`
- `getUserName()` returns: `~Foo`
- `getPassword()` returns: `~p@$$word`
- `getHost()` returns: `servername.local`
- `getIP()` returns: `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX`
- `getPort()` returns: `80`
- `getAuthority()` returns: `~Foo:~p@$$word@servername.local`
- `getIPAuthority()` returns: `~Foo:~p@$$word@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX`
- `getPath()` returns: `~this/is/a/./path/test.php`
- `getAfterPath()` returns: `?foo=bar#frag`
- `getQuery()` returns: `foo=bar`
- `getFragment()` returns: `frag`

If you are using mDNS in your projects, you may have discovered many microcontroller libraries do not support mDNS in all areas.  This library will additionally ([but conditionally](#mdns-support)) re-parse a URL and replace the `*.local` hostname with the resolved IP address.

:exclamation: IMPORTANT: Using any of the network-based methods in a timer (i.e. Ticker) will crash or hang your program. This hang is not a shortcoming of this library; it is how radio-functions (networking being one) work.

## Public Methods

### Core Methods

- `bool setUrl(String)` - Pass the URL to be handled to the class
- `String getUrl()` - Return a processed/normalized URI in the following format: `scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment]`
- `String getIPUrl()` - Return a processed URI with the host replaced by the IP address in the following format: `scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment]` (useful for mDNS URLs)
- `String getScheme()` - Get the scheme (currently only handles http and https)
- `String getUserInfo()` - Return username and password (if present)
- `String getUserName()` - Returns username (if present)
- `String getPassword()` - Returns password (if present)
- `String getHost()` - Return host name
- `word getPort()` - Return port (if present) if non-standard
- `String getAuthority()` - Return the authority (if present) in the following format: `[userinfo@]host[:port]`
- `String getIPAuthority()` - Return the authority (if present) in the following format: `[userinfo@]XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX[:port]` (useful for mDNS URLs, will use cached IPs if they exist)
- `String getPath()` - Returns the path segment (if present) with any query or fragment removed
- `String getAfterPath()` - Returns query and fragment segments (if present)
- `String getQuery()` - Returns query (if present)
- `String getFragment()` - Returns fragment (if present)

### Original Utility Methods

:exclamation: These methods are deprecated and slated to be removed.

These utility methods are dependant upon the class' instantiation and current URL string.

- `bool isMDNS()` - Return true or false determination of whether the class' host is a valid mDNS name
- `IPAddress getIP()` - Return IP address of class' host (always does lookup)

### Utility Methods

These methods are intended to extend functionality of the TCP libraries, and may be leveraged independent of a specific instance declaration.

- `bool isMDNS(const char *hostName)` - Returns true if `hostName` is a valid mDNS name
- `IPAddress getIP(const char * hostName)` - Return IP address of `hostName` (always does lookup)
- `bool isValidIP(const char * hostName)` - Returns true if `hostName` represents a valid IP address string
- `int labelCount(const char * hostName)` - Integer of the number of labels in the `hostName`
- `bool isANumber(const char * str)` - Returns true if `str` is a valid number
- `bool isValidLabel(const char *label)` - Returns true if the `label` is a valid DNS label
- `bool isValidHostName(const char *hostName)` - Return true if the `hostName` passed is a valid DNS, mDNS or IP hostname

## Progress:

- [X] Convert percent-encoded triplets to uppercase
- [X] Convert the scheme and host to lowercase
- [X] Decode percent-encoded triplets of unreserved characters
- [ ] Remove dot-segments
- [X] Convert an empty path to a "/" path
- [X] Remove the default port
- [X] ~~Add a trailing "/" to a non-empty path (may remove this)~~ (removed this after some thought)
- [X] Add validity check functions (not yet part of the initialization)

## Installation

Installation is particular to the platform with which you are developing:

### PlatformIO

This library is available as `lbussy/LCBUrl` in [PlatformIO's library manager](https://platformio.org/lib/show/6778/LCBUrl).

### Arduino IDE

LCBUrl is published via the [Arduino Library Manager](https://www.ardu-badge.com/LCBUrl).  You can include this library in your project by navigating to Sketch -> Include Libraries -> Manage Libraries (or Ctrl - Shift - I). Type `LCBUrl` in the search bar:

### Manual

To install this library, place this entire folder as a subfolder in your
`./lib/targets/libraries` folder.

When installed, this library should contain the following files:

```
./lib/targets/libraries/LCBUrl                    (this library's folder)
./lib/targets/libraries/LCBUrl/examples           (the examples in the "open" menu)
./lib/targets/libraries/LCBUrl/keywords.txt       (the syntax coloring file)
./lib/targets/libraries/LCBUrl/library.properties (properties of this library)
./lib/targets/libraries/LCBUrl/LICENSE            (the license for this library)
./lib/targets/libraries/LCBUrl/README.md          (this file)
./lib/targets/libraries/LCBUrl/src/LCBUrl.cpp     (the library implementation file)
./lib/targets/libraries/LCBUrl/src/LCBUrl.h       (the library description file)
```

## Building

Ensure that you add a corresponding line to the top of your sketch:

``` cpp
#include <LCBUrl.h>
```

To stop using this library, delete that line from your sketch.

## mDNS Support {#mdns-support}

To enable mDNS support, define the macro before including the library:

``` cpp
#define LCBURL_MDNS
#include <LCBUrl.h>
```

Or, define it globally in the platformio.ini or compiler definitions:

``` ini
-DLCBURL_MDNS
```

Without this definition, the mDNS functions will return failures.

### mDNS on ESP8266

After initial release of this library, the upstream `WiFi.hostByName()` stopped resolving mDNS queries.  I am exploring other options to provide name resolution for mDNS on the ESP8266.
